Evan Hatton
Have not recieved help.
Helped Katie Trombetta and Joseph Henderson by walking through the logic behind my recursive solution for Increasing Sequence.
Took inspiration for read_numbers from some of the examples provided on cplusplus.com, specifically while looking at the reference pages for fstream.peek() and fstream.get()
